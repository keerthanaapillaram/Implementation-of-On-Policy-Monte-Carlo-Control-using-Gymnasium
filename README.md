# Implementation-of-On-Policy-Monte-Carlo-Control-using-Gymnasium
---

## Aim

To implement **Monte Carlo Control** using the Gymnasium `FrozenLake-v1` environment and learn an improved policy by estimating the action-value function from complete episodes.

---

## Problem Statement

The `FrozenLake-v1` environment consists of frozen tiles, holes, a start state, and a goal state. The agent must learn a policy that helps it reach the goal while avoiding holes.

The objective of this experiment is to:

1. Generate complete episodes using the Gymnasium environment.
2. Estimate the action-value function $Q(s,a)$ using Monte Carlo returns.
3. Use epsilon-greedy action selection for exploration and exploitation.
4. Improve the policy based on the learned Q-values.
5. Display the final Q-table, estimated state-value function, learned policy, and learning curve.

## Environment Description

The experiment uses the FrozenLake-v1 environment from Gymnasium.

The default 4 × 4 FrozenLake environment is:

S  F  F  F
F  H  F  H
F  F  F  H
H  F  F  G

Where:

S = Starting state
F = Frozen/safe tile
H = Hole
G = Goal

The environment contains:

16 states
4 actions

Actions

| Action Number | Direction |
| ------ | ------- |
| 0      | Left    |
| 1      | Down    |
| 2      | Right   |
| 3      | Up      |

The agent receives a reward of 1 when it reaches the goal. Other transitions generally provide a reward of 0.

In this experiment:

is_slippery=False

is used so that the environment is deterministic and the effect of the learned policy can be clearly observed.


## Theory

Monte Carlo methods learn from **complete episodes**. An episode is a sequence of states, actions, and rewards:

$$
S_0, A_0, R_1, S_1, A_1, R_2, \ldots, S_T
$$

The return from time step $t$ is:

$$
G_t = R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + \gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \cdots
$$

Monte Carlo Control estimates the action-value function:

$$
Q(s,a)
$$

The incremental update rule is:

$$
Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha \left[G_t - Q(s,a)\right]
$$

Where:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $s$ | Current state |
| $a$ | Action taken in state $s$ |
| $G_t$ | Return from time step $t$ |
| $Q(s,a)$ | Action-value estimate |
| $\alpha$ | Learning rate |
| $\gamma$ | Discount factor |

## Epsilon-Greedy Policy

Monte Carlo Control uses epsilon-greedy action selection.

With probability $\epsilon$, the agent explores by selecting a random action.

With probability $1 - \epsilon$, the agent exploits by selecting the action with the highest Q-value.

The greedy action is selected as:

$$
a = \arg\max_a Q(s,a)
$$

The final learned policy is:

$$
\pi(s) = \arg\max_a Q(s,a)
$$
